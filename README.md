Temperature Forecast Prediction App 

This is a powerful, experimental temperature forecasting application built using Shiny in R. The main goal of the app is to demonstrate the differences between temperature forecasts based on various factors‚Äîsuch as wind, pressure, and humidity (provided by an external API)‚Äîversus forecasts calculated solely using historical temperature data through an ARIMA time series model. This application leverages both historical temperature data and forecast data from the Open Meteo API. The app uses the ARIMA model to predict future temperatures by analyzing temperature data from the last 5 years (including the current year).

This application allows you to visualize and predict temperature trends using historical data. No installation is required ‚Äì it runs directly in your browser.

# Key Features:

Temperature Predictions: Users can generate temperature forecasts (minimum and maximum temperature) for 1 to 10 days ahead for cities worldwide.

Hourly Forecast: The app also provides hourly temperature predictions for the following day.

Historical Data Access: Users can view and interact with a detailed table of the historical data used for model predictions.

CSV Export: Users can download the forecast data or historical data for any given period as CSV files.

# How It Works: 
Forecasting with ARIMA: The app analyzes temperature data from the past days over 5 years, packed in a month time series (including the current year) to train an ARIMA model. Based on this model, it generates forecasts for future temperatures.

Forecast Data: The app retrieves forecast data from Open Meteo and combines it with historical temperature data to produce accurate predictions.

Global Coverage: Forecasts are available for cities across the globe, allowing users to input any city for temperature predictions.

Interactive Table: A table displays the historical data used in the forecast model, allowing users to better understand the basis of the predictions.

CSV Export: The app gives users the ability to export the forecast data or historical data to CSV files for further analysis or record-keeping.

# üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies Used:
This app.R is built entirely in R using the Shiny web application framework and integrates multiple tools for data analysis, modeling, and visualization:

* **Shiny:** For building interactive web applications directly in R.

* **httr & jsonlite:** For fetching and processing weather data from APIs.

* **dplyr & tidyr:** For data wrangling and transformation.

* **lubridate:** For flexible and intuitive date/time manipulation.

* **forecast:** For ARIMA time series modeling and forecasting.

* **ggplot2 & plotly:** For rich, interactive and static visualizations.

* **DT:** For interactive, searchable tables.

* **lutz:** For handling time zones based on geographic coordinates.

This tech stack enables the app to provide dynamic forecasts, time series predictions, and comparisons of modeled vs. API-based weather data ‚Äî all directly in your browser, without additional software installation.

# Use Case: 
The app is ideal for users looking to get accurate and reliable weather forecasts for up to 10 days, based on a combination of historical data and advanced statistical modeling. Whether you're planning a trip, managing outdoor events, or simply curious about future weather trends, this app provides valuable insights into the expected weather conditions. It helps demonstrate how predictions vary depending on whether they rely purely on historical trends or include additional weather variables.
